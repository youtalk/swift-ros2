// RclTransportSession+Action.swift
// Action Server / Client implementation for the rcl transport (M8).
//
// Serialize-shim design (spec §20.6): the C bridge converts bytes to typed
// rosidl wrapper structs via rmw_deserialize / rmw_serialize and calls the
// typed rcl_action API. This layer stays byte-oriented and reuses the exact
// wire-path frame helpers (`ActionFrameDecoder`), so the public action API
// behaves identically on `.rcl` and on the wire transports. The one
// rcl-specific addition: rcl_action tracks accepted goals server-side (its
// status publisher and result-timeout expiry read that tracking), so this
// layer mirrors the umbrella's status snapshots into rcl's goal state
// machine via the seam's acceptGoal / updateGoalState / notifyGoalDone.
