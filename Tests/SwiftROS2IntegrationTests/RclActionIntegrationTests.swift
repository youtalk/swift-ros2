/// Serves example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci through the real rcl +
/// rmw_cyclonedds_cpp stack and asserts a goal from a real ROS 2 host was
/// accepted, fed back, and completed (M8 actions verification: the
/// serialize-shim rcl_action server answers a real rclpy action client).
/// Gated: requires the RCL backend built (SWIFT_ROS2_RCL) and a reachable
/// Jazzy host (LINUX_IP). This is a runbook test — CI never runs it. Start
/// the test, then within 60 s issue the goal from the host:
///
///   ros2 action send_goal /swift_ros2_rcl/fibonacci \
///     example_interfaces/action/Fibonacci "{order: 5}" --feedback
///
/// The host must print per-step feedback and "Result: sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2,
/// 3, 5]" with status SUCCEEDED. If no goal arrives within 60 s the test
/// skips (the host side is manual), unless RCL_SVC_EXPECT_CALL=1 is set — in
/// which case the absence of a goal is a failure.
///
/// If the host's send_goal stays at "Waiting for an action server" the LAN
/// likely drops multicast (typical on Wi-Fi): set unicast peers on BOTH
/// sides via CYCLONEDDS_URI, each pointing at the other machine —
/// `<CycloneDDS><Domain><Discovery><Peers><Peer address="<other-ip>"/>
/// </Peers></Discovery></Domain></CycloneDDS>` (verified 2026-06-11:
/// multicast discovery failed Mac<->host, unicast peers round-tripped the
/// full goal/feedback/result exchange).
