/// Jazzy host (LINUX_IP). This is a runbook test — CI never runs it. Start
/// the test, then within 60 s issue the call from the host:
///
///   ros2 service call /swift_ros2_rcl/add_two_ints \

/// The host must print "sum: 5". If no request arrives within 60 s the test
/// skips (the host side is manual), unless RCL_SVC_EXPECT_CALL=1 is set — in
/// which case the absence of a request is a failure.
